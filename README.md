# Count-Master-Demo-Game
This is the work I did to create a clone of the Count Master game. I tried to create some basic mechanics used in the game.

## Mechanics:

* Movement
  * Swipe movement
  * Following the team leader  
* Team
  * Increase the number of members of the team
  * Reducing the number of members of the team
  * Build a tower
  * Sit on the stairs
* UI
  * You won
    * Go to next level
  * You lost
    * Play again

## Gameplay:
